ðŸ’¡ **Question 1**

Given a linked list ofÂ **N**Â nodes such that it may contain a loop.

A loop here means that the last node of the link list is connected to the node at position X(1-based index). If the link list does not have any loop, X=0.

Remove the loop from the linked list, if it is present, i.e. unlink the last node which is forming the loop.
Example 1:
```
Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
X = 2
Output:1
Explanation:The link list looks like
1 -> 3 -> 4
     ^    |
     |____|
A loop is present. If you remove it
successfully, the answer will be 1.

```

Example 2:
```
Input:
N = 4
value[] = {1,8,3,4}
X = 0
Output:1
Explanation:TheÂ Linked list does not
contains any loop.

ðŸ’¡ **Question 3**

Given a Linked List of size N, where every node represents a sub-linked-list and contains two pointers:(i) aÂ **next**Â pointer to the next node,(ii) aÂ **bottom**Â pointerÂ to a linked list where this node is head.Each of theÂ sub-linked-list is in sorted order.Flatten the Link List such that all the nodes appear in a single level while maintaining the sorted order.Â **Note:**Â The flattened list will be printed using the bottom pointer instead of next pointer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
5 -> 10 -> 19 -> 28

Output:Â 5-> 7-> 8- > 10 -> 19-> 20->

Given theÂ `head`Â of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and returnÂ *the reordered list*.

Return an integer arrayÂ `answer`Â whereÂ `answer[i]`Â is the value of the next greater node of theÂ `ith`Â node (**1-indexed**). If theÂ `ith`Â node does not have a next greater node, setÂ `answer[i] = 0`.
